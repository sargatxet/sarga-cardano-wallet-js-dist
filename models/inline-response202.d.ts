     * A list of minimum coin values that each output in a payment must satisfy. The values themselves depends on two things:    - (a) Some updatable protocol parameters fixed by the network.   - (b) The nature of the outputs (i.e. the kind of assets it includes).  The list is a direct 1:1 mapping of the requested outputs. Said differently, it has the **same number of items** and **items are ordered in the same way** as **requested outputs** are ordered. In the case where there's no explicitly requested outputs (e.g. when calculating fee for delegation), this list is empty.  For example, an output containing only `Ada` may require to be of at least `1 Ada`. An output containing only an hypothetical `AppleCoin` may require to also carry a minimum of `1.2 Ada`. Note that no matter what, a minimum coin value is always given in Lovelace / Ada.  > ℹ️ This mechanism is used by the protocol to protect against flooding of the network with worthless assets. By requiring a minimum coin value to every UTxO, they are given an intrinsic value indexed itself on the value of Ada.
