 * An asset on the Cardano blockchain. An asset is uniquely identified by its `policy_id` and `asset_name` (together, these form the _asset id_).  Two assets with the same `asset_name` and `policy_id` are interchangeable. Yet, different assets with a same `policy_id` but different `asset_name` are treated as separate assets, as are two assets with the same `asset_name` but different `policy_id`.
